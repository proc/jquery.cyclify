jQuery.cyclify()

This is a jQuery plugin that lets the user cycle through a bunch of divs, one at a time.
Additional easing effects can be gained by including jQuery UI.
Requires jQuery and these CSS classes to work:

wrapper-class *can be any class*
    cycle-controls
        cycle-prev
        cycle-next
        cycle-begin
        cycle-end
    cycle-cycles
        div
        div
        div
        ...

USAGE:
  // all options are optional
  $('.wrapper-class').cyclify({
    loop       : true, //whether or not to loop when cycle hits endpoints
    transition : 'linear', // name of easing function to use ( default: swing )
    delay      : 100, // animation time
    success : function(current_div) { //callback on current div ( after cycle )
      alert('the current div is ' + $(current_div));
    }
  });
